### The History of this History Harvest


Who are you, and what do your objects say about you? How do the objects that are special to you reflect your family and community identities? What objects remind you that you belong somewhere?


Every day, the objects we own or interact with reveal something about us. These histories may be hidden or invisible to others, but meaningful to us nonetheless. The objects we wear, those that we keep in our homes, those that we carry with us in our bags--any of these might reflect something about our identities that others don't know about. Every day, we make history. 


The All Counties, All Countries History Harvest is an opportunity to share the objects that matter to you as markers of your identity, or signs that you belong to a community, a place, a people. Identities are reflected in the objects people hold dear. How does your object tell your story?


In Fall 2019, Indiana University's [Center for Research on Race and Ethnicity in Society (CRRES](http://crres.indiana.edu/) will host the inaugural All Counties, All Countries History Harvest. This type of community-history project, which had its first iteration in the [History Department at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://history.unl.edu/history-harvest), gets the public involved in the digitization and preservation of sentimental artifacts that aren't likely to make it into museums or archives. Although these objects are often quite ordinary, they reveal a great deal about people's everyday lives and how they think of themselves as parts of larger communities.


To kick-start this process, we invite you to identify an object that speaks to your identity or sense of belonging, and bring it to be digitized during one of two History Harvest events in October 2019. With your permission, we will digitize your object, do a really short interview with you about it, and add it to a digital exhibit. The object will go home with you, leaving its digital form to be preserved here with other objects that have made their way into IUB's history.
