 I'm currently doing research on Alexander Hamilton. My whole year has been learning about Hamilton and his life and how his letters correspond to the musical lyrics. This book has become a sort of security blanket for me. I take it everywhere. While it's incredibly heavy and takes up a lot of space, it comforts me to bring it with me. Also, it's honestly a great book to read.
