 Vans are a staple shoe for most skaters. Their waffle sole makes it very useful when gripping the board. I brought these shoes to campus because they gripped my razor scooter well, which I use to go to classes when the weather is nice.

 In 1977, Vans #36, theÂ Old Skool, debuted with the now famous Vans Sidestripe. The Old Skool is Vans' first skate shoe that incorporated leather panels for increased durability. What first started as a random doodle by Paul Van Doren, originally referred to as the "jazz stripe," has become the unmistakable hallmark of the Vans brand. Over time, skaters adopted Vans as their favorite shoe in California due to their durability and usefulness in skating.

 These are some shoes that go on my feet. They have a tan sole, checkerboard pattern, black toe area, white laces, and a white mid-sole.

 I didn't come to campus with these when I first moved in in August. Instead, I bought them over Labor Day weekend because I needed some shoes that didn't wear down so fast on my razor scooter. They've now become incorporated into my wardrobe and even changed how I dressed. They are now used more for fashion rather than their function.

- I think the description a lot. Maybe add on your shoe size to give an item of dimensions. I would also think about deleting the second sentence
- Maybe edit the first paragraph of the item about to flow a bit more
- Maybe think about attaching the Vans mission statement ?
