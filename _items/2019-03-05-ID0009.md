#### About this object

These are some shoes that go on my feet. They have a tan sole, checkerboard pattern, black toe area, white laces, and a white mid-sole.

#### Why this object matters

I didn't come to campus with these when I first moved in in August. Instead, I bought them over Labor Day weekend because I needed some shoes that didn't wear down so fast on my razor scooter. They've now become incorporated into my wardrobe even though I don't use my scooter anymore due to the weather.
