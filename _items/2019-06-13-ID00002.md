 This was the first fountain pen I ever purchased.

 This pen links me to an analog past, and connects me to fellow fountain-pen enthusiasts. I spend a lot of time writing on a keyboard and working on a computer. Unhooking from that often hectic workflow, picking up a pen inked in any one of over 600 colors you can buy these days, and writing on a pad reminds me to slow down and reflect more carefully on what I'm writing down.
