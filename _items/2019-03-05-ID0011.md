 This is an old tin can that's filled with paint brushes and other art tools. The modern paintbrush began to be produced in the 18th century with the brush part coming from the hair of different types of animals. Nowadays, the bristles are synthetically made. These paint brushes most likely date from the late 20th century. Without the knowledge of the previous owner, the manufacturing date remains unknown.

 I like to paint and do crafty stuff, but for a long time I didn't have paint brushes other than the type that come from cheap paint-by-numbers. A friend of my grandma's gave me her paint brushes before she moved back to Arizona.
