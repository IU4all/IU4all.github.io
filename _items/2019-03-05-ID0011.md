#### About this object

I have an old tin can that's filled with paint brushes and other art tools.

#### Why this object matters

<blockquote>
I like to paint and do crafty stuff but for a long time I didn't have paint brushes other than the type that come from cheap paint-by-numbers. A friend of my grandma's gave me her paint brushes before she moved back to Arizona.
