 This is a pencil case that looks like an old card check out form for a library book. It's stained from extensive use, and currently holds pens, pencils, erasers, and post-it-notes.

 I got this pencil case as a gift when I graduated from high school. I have carried it in my backpack every single day of class both in my undergrad and graduate programs. Using different writing utensils and post-its is a major part of my academic experience and success. It's also a force of habit now. If I don't have it with me, I feel like I'm missing something
