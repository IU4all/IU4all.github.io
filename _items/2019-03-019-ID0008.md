  Garmin, previously Pro Nav, entered the business as a company that specialized in automotive, aviation, and marine GPS. 2003 the company developed its first mobile GPS model for users to wear as an exercise watch. exercise watches were designed to monitor distance travelled, heart rates, and GPS the locations travelled to a cellular device. With this information the watch can calculate whether you are exercising hard enough, where and how far you have travelled, and track different routes that are taken when exercising.

  Iâ€™ve had this watch for four years and rarely go anywhere without it. I have gone through many races and competitions with the watch so it means a lot to me because the records from all my runs over the past years are recorded on it].
