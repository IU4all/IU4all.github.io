 This photograph reminds me of my father, who listened to music at every opportunity. He taught me to love soul, R&B and jazz music at an early age. This photograph evokes for me the comfort of music as part of my family's everyday.

 This photo ties me to the African-American musical tradition that also reflects my identity as a Black person. I have always been able to draw on the knowledge my father imparted to me about African-American music to connect myself to a wider community of Black folks.
