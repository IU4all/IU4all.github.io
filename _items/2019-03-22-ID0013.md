 My best friend gave it to me out of the blue one day. He knows that I love Pokémon, and he said that I would take better care of it than he would. I collect pins, generally speaking, and I put them on my backpack. Often they fall off, but this one is trusty and has stuck with me for a long time. Pokémon has been part of my life for the entire 22 years that I've been around, but this pin is even more sweet and sentimtal because my best friend gave it to me. It's also practical because it strikes up conversations with people.
