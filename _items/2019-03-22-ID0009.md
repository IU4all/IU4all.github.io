 This was the first kind of band shirt I ever owned. I was inspired to get it after listening to their music a lot for several months when I was around the age of 17. I really enjoyed the music, with many of the songs resonating for me. Personally My Chemical Romance was one of the first "emo" bands I was truly into, and it really opened me up to a lot of other bands and genres of music that were particularly popular in the 2000s. The band helped me through some turbulent teenage years and the inevitable emotions that coming of age has.
