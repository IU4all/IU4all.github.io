 The object is a telephone, manufactured .ca 1894 by Stromberg-Carlson. Both Stromberg and Carlson were employees of the Bell Company before quitting when the initial patents on the telephone expired because they believed that they could make a better telephone. This specific model used the first electromagnetic receiver in history, and used a more robust magneto which produced a higher voltage- making it ideal for use in rural areas along longer phone lines, earning it the nickname, "The Farmer's Friend." For more information on this phone, see [this article by the Western Illinois Museum](https://www.wimuseum.org/stromberg-carlson-telephone/)

 This is a phone that sits in my apartment. I found it in an antique shop and did light restoration work on it, making it theoretically functional. It's a cool conversation piece in my apartment that has come to be part of my portfolio of restoring antique appliances to working order.
