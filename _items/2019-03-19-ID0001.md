 The object is a telephone, manufactured .ca 1894 by Stromberg-Carlson. Both Stromberg and Carlson were employees of the Bell Company before quitting when the initial patents on the telephone expired because they believed that they could make a better telephone. This specific model used the first electromagnetic receiver in history, and used a more robust magneto which produced a higher voltage- making it ideal for use in rural areas along longer phone lines, earning it the nickname, "The Farmer's Friend."      CITATIONS AND OUTSIDE LINK, BUT INFO IS GOOD AND CONCIISE.

 This is a phone that sits in my apartment. I found it in an antique shop and did light restoration work on it, making it theoretically functional. It's a cool piece that has come to be part of my portfolio of restoring antique appliances to working order.
