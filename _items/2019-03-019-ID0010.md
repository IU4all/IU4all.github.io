shortdesc: I have a MacBook air, and a dark green case that holds some stickers that technically express my interests. There's a sticker of Angela Davis, one of the 1984 Olympics, some stickers in Arabic and an Lebanese singer. There's also a sticker of an activist organization I've done work with. There's also a "modern art" sticker on it as well as a sticker promoting something environmental.

  Technology, including personal devices, spread quickly due to several different patterns of adoption. Computer systems were invented in the 1940's and were large, costly, and complex. Only a small subset of the population could access a computer, including academics and military personnel. By the late 1940's only forty computer systems existed. By the 1960's, however, there were about 6,000 computer systems. Calculating the amount of IT systems that exist in the world now is difficult not only because there are so many but because they're embedded in objects such as household items. IT systems became so widespread due to favorable economic, social, and legal environments. Technology has become less expensive as it improved, making it more accessible. IT systems also developed unique characteristics as well as the ability to move software from an older generation of IT systems to a newer generation, making development easier. Countries also had to have the appropriate social and legal environments. Laws encouraging IT systems, especially patent and copyright laws that protected the invention of new technology were created, and educations systems changed to educate students on how to use technology sufficiently. In addition to that, governments played a large role in the dispersion of technology. for example, the U.S. heavily invested in IT systems because it helped stimulate the economy and gave the country and edge in the Cold War.

  My laptop is my pride and joy (laughing but serious). I tend to write most things out (assignments, notes, etcetera) but my laptop contains programs and documents and all my assignments and duties. Also, because I use it so frequently, I decorated it and made it truly mine. It also costed me a lot of money and was one of the most expensive purchases I've made independantly.
