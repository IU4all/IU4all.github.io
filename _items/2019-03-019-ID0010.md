shortdesc: I have a MacBook air, and a dark green case that holds some stickers that technically express my interests. There's a sticker of Angela Davis, one of the 1984 Olympics, some stickers in Arabic and an Lebanese singer. There's also a sticker of an activist organization I've done work with. There's also a "modern art" sticker on it as well as a sticker promoting something environmental.

There's a sticker of Angela Davis, one of the 1984 Olympics, some stickers in Arabic and an Lebanese singer I like. There's also a sticker of an activist organization I've done work with. There's also a "modern art" sticker on it as well as a sticker promoting something environmental.

  My laptop is my pride and joy (laughing but serious). I tend to write most things out (assignments, notes, etcetera) but my laptop contains programs and documents and all my assignments and duties. Also, because I use it so frequently, I decorated it and made it truly mine. It also costed me a lot of money and was one of the most expensive purchases I've made independantly.
