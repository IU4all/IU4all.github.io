 Phone case wallets became popular as University students were searching for ways to organize their important belongings in one place. Phone wallets would typically be found on the back of a student’s phone case. They are offered from the student recreation center for free. The Recreation center offers these to help students with carrying ID’s and credit cards when they are wearing athletic apparel that lacks pockets. With room to carry up to 4 cards, importance of carrying a wallet is significantly diminished. Additionally, technological advancements have lessened the importance of physical currency and has made digital purchases much more convenient.

 The significance comes from the accessibility it has provided me as a student and the ability to not carry around a wallet when absolutely necessary. This keeps the objects that are extremely important to me centrally located all in one spot so I don't have to keep track of more than one thing.
