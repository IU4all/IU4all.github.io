#### About this object

A wallet that is attached to the back of a cell phone to hold credit cards, debit cards, ID, etc. Black with IU logo and recreational sports imprinted on it.

#### Why this object matters

The significance comes from the accessibility it has provided me as a student and the ability to not carry around a wallet when absolutely necessary. This keeps the objects that are extremely important to me centrally located all in one spot so I don't have to keep track of more than one thing.
