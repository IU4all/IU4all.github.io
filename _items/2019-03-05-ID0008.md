 A wallet that is attached to the back of a cell phone to hold credit cards, debit cards, ID, etc. Black with IU logo and recreational sports imprinted on it.

Phone case wallets became popular as University students were searching for ways to keep all of their important belongings in one place. Phone wallets, such as this one, are what would typically be found on the back of a student’s phone. These phone wallets in particular are offered from the student recreation center for free. The Recreation center offers these to help students with carrying ID’s and credit cards when they are wearing athletic apparel that lacks pockets. With room to carry up to 4 cards, importance of carrying a wallet is significantly diminished. Additionally, technological advancements have lessened the importance of physical currency and has made digital purchases much more convenient.

 The significance comes from the accessibility it has provided me as a student and the ability to not carry around a wallet when absolutely necessary. This keeps the objects that are extremely important to me centrally located all in one spot so I don't have to keep track of more than one thing.
