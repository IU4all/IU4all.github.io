  A 3/4" neon pink pin with a female symbol in black and the words "Nasty Knitter" in white.
  
  After Trump's election women feared that their rights would be taken away. [The Women's March](https://womensmarch.com/) was a way to stand up for women's independence. The Women's March includes all sorts of women: women of color, transgender women, lesbian women, and anyone else. It is a movement that celebrates what women do, which includes knitting. The play on words "Nasty Knitter" connects women's love of knitting with fighting for their rights. This pin, like others, displays an idea that is being supported and that wants reognition from others.

  My mother-in-law and I are both knitters. She gave me this in winter of 2017 after she and a group of her knitting friends wore them in the January 2016 Women's March.
