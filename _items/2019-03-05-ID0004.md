 Pictured above is a black G&L guitar with a turtle shell scratch protector. The guitar also has a blue and indigo strap. 
G&L is a guitar design and production company founded by Leo Fender, George Fullerton, and Dale Hyatt in 1979. G&L instruments were an attempt by Leo Fender and his associates to create a more perfected version of the Fender guitar. The small scale of its production allows for more customization of their instruments.

 I bought my own guitar in early 2018 from a guitar shop my family’s been going to for three generations. This is my first real guitar that’s not a hand-me-down from a previous family member. I practice almost everyday and make music regularly.
