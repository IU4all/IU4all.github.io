 This book maintains the organic chemistry organizational pattern set forth by other organic chemistry publishers. Chapters are divided based on on the functional group and types of reactions that occur with that functional group. This layout helps strengthen a student's understanding of reactions, mechanisms, and synthetic analysis and practical applications of molecules. The eighth edition corrects issues from previous editions and refines the teaching structure to promote understanding. An optional addon (not included with the textbook naturally) is SaplingPlus, Mastering Chemistry, except better.

 I was required to purchase this book for my orgo class this semester. I initially had a couple of extraordinarily crappy PDFs that frustrated me enough to warrant the price tag for the physical textbook, but now that I have a textbook, everything makes so much more sense.
