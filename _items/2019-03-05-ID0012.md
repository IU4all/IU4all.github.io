#### About this object

Traditional-looking textbook, roughly 9"x12"x1.5" weighing approximately 2lb with a frog on the cover.

#### Why this object matters

<blockquote>
I was required to purchase this book for my orgo class this semester. I initially had a couple of extraordinarily crappy PDFs that frustrated me enough to warrant the price tag for the physical textbook, but now that I have a text book, everything makes soo much more sense.
