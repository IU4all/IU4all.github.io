#### About this object

A collection of four small pins: one with yellow background and a speech bubble with the words "what the hell are you doing?", one with a white background with a light pink frame with two flowers at the top and bottom that says "girls support girls", one light blue that says "women supporting women", and one with the gay pride flag covering the entire pin

#### Why this object matters

These objects symbolize my commitment to women's rights and intersectional feminism, as well as a way to show off my sexual orientation and a reminder of my time at the women's march.
