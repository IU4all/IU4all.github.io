 This is a rectangular sheath designed to fit in a shirt's breast pocket and hold objects, traditionally (and in this case) fountain pens.  The back side, which is longer than the front, is made of a white plastic. The front is a transparent plastic and is is folded at the top, so that the top half or so of the panel is composed of two layers, to which the clips of the pens' caps are traditionally fastened.  The inside of the pocket is stained with several colours of ink, although this is obscured when it is holding pens. Your basic cheap pocket protector.

 As the stains on the inside of the protector show, this object has saved several of my shirts from being stained with ink from the fountain pens that I like to use (as a drawback of these pens is that they have a tendency to leak ink easily).  Given the rarity of both the pens and protector among many populations today, and its highly visible position, the objects combined can also be used to make a fashion statement.
