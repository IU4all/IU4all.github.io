 There are a few women in this book that really speak to me and empower me to want to further my education. My mother gave this to me before I left for college. She wanted me to have this as a parting gift. She pulled it out and she was like, "I just want you to have this to remember me and like never feel down. Like if you’re behind, 'cause all these women were behind at one point and they powered through it..." She’s been very supportive for whatever I want to do.
