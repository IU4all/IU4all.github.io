 When I was in elementary back in my home country, I used to walk a mile or two to go to school from home and from school to home. On my way, there’s this small store that sells toys and other stuff for children. I would always spend a few minutes staring at this pink teddy bear on display. I don’t know if my mom walked me to school or home one day that she knew that I’ve been staring at this teddy bear. One night few days before Christmas, I went with my mom to buy something from some store. She probably saw me goggling at the teddy bear and asked me if I liked the teddy bear. She bought it and thought that it was from me but she said that someone had asked her to buy it for her and wrap it (she was great at gift wrapping). It was probably the first time I felt my heart breaking. Early in the morning of Christmas, my mom gave me a gift and in it was the teddy bear along with some candies. As soon as I saw it, I hugged it immediately.My favorite color was pink and at that time, I was away from my all of my siblings and my father. I was bullied and didn’t have that much friends. I used to cry every night. It was like my cry-buddy, my little sister, my friend and my playmate. I don’t think I could ever sleep without it because it reminds me of my mom but mostly it reminds me of my innocence.
