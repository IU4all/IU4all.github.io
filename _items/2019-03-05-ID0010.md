 This pin is a small, heart-shaped, metal pin that is blue, yellow, and pink to represent pansexual pride colors. It was given as a gift to show support of coming out as Pansexual. It was purchased from Amazon and is normally worn on a backpack.

 Pins have been used in the United States since 1789 for George Washingtonâ€™s first inauguration. Then, they were patented in 1892 by Benjamin Whitehead. Pins are used to show support or express a certain feeling. The pin is used so others can see and hopefully will also support LGBTQ+ members.

 My roommate was one of the first people I came out to as pansexual and she bought me his pin for my birthday to show support.
