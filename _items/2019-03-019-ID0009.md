 A silver Lenovo laptop with stickers of macaroons, an Iceland emblem, cacti, a dolphin, the UN logo, and a cartoon of an Indian man with the words "Curry Master." They are a bit worn, but I have had gradually added them since freshman year. It is one of the most valuable objects I own, and because of this, is something is very important to me and will hopefully be in my life for a very long time!

 I carry my laptop with me wherever I go, and overtime, it has become a symbol of who I am. I am really picky with what stickers I get, and the ones that I have chosen symbolize different parts of who I am through art and humor from my ethnicity and culture to my favorite things, aspirations, and my love of travel.
