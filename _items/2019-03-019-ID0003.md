shortdesc: A black, faux-leather, bi-fold wallet.  The outside face is smooth, while the inside face contains four tiered pockets on each side of the fold to hold business cards, credit cards, and the like.  The main pocket has a divider down the centre, so that one can separate cash from, e.g., receipts or coupons.  The outside face also has a small, slide-out holder, with a clear plastic pocket on one side (designed to hold an identification card of some sort), and several tiered pockets (similar to the ones inside the main device).

 It holds my money and essential identification papers, so I never leave home without it.
