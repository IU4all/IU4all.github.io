<h3>Background</h3>

<p>We are a first-year-research History class at Indiana University Bloomington looking to preserve sentimental and practical artifacts of importance to the IU student body.

<p>We're doing that by conducting a History Harvest, which means if you have something that's important to you, we can digitize it, do a really short interview with you about it, and add it to the IU archives without you having to leave the object with us forever.
