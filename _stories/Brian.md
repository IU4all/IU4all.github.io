When we decide to put on a shirt, or a pair of pants for a day, we make this decision based on a few things: comfortability; of course, we want what we wear to feel good and make us happy in that way, appearance; we all want to look good, and type of clothing; if it's cold, we aren't gallavanting around in a tank-top and short shorts. These are the main pillars for dressing ourselves, and preparing for a day. However, there is a level to our clothing that delves far deeper than a base of practicality. When we choose a garment to wear, this decision often reflects a mood, or moreover, a personality. My rundown and battered Timberland boots provide practical advantages such as multi-environmental utility, but I could get the same use from a new, and potentially improved, pair of shoes. Instead, I keep these boots because they symbolize something deeper, a concept that proves universal throughout the world of clothing and brands.   

## Clothes and the Personal Brand 

The [Indiana University Archives Items Collection](https://libraries.indiana.edu/archives) contain a variety of instances in which this concept of clothing symbolizinig a deeper sense of self are displayed. The [1959 Theatre Mask Collection](http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/archivesphotos/results/item.do?itemId=P0053737&searchId=0&searchResultIndex=2) presents an interesting angle of this concept. Masks, while often worn in a artistic or theatrical setting for performance purposes, are indeed a subset of clothing, and can be worn and displayed to change a persons affiliation or background completely. It may not seem this way, but people wear different brands of clothing or styles the same reason as one puts on a mask - to represent or illustrate a stance or opinion, or to characterize themselves to onlookers. Another vector of thought to consider in regards to clothing as self-expression takes us to another form of art, [A Caricatured Painting in the IU Archives](http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/archivesphotos/results/item.do?itemId=P0034367&searchId=0&searchResultIndex=1). Clothing is certainly one of the most effective means of self-expression on a daily basis, but perhaps the most popular, and perhaps original method, was artistry. Creating or producing art is a clear and authentic way of display how you may see the world – it allows viewers, similar to that of clothing and different brands, to experience ones style and expressive choices. Caricatures specifically emobdy this idea, as a portrait art form tendered to exaggerating, emphasizing, and imitating striking characterists and features clearly parallels the concept of clothing as self-expression. We choose what to wear based on what will emphasize and embody our characterists, and our character traits.     

Timberland Boots initial application was for construction and outdoor physical activity before they were revolutionalized for fashion purposes in a "counter-culture"-esque trend. Since then, men and women have worn the boots for fashion purposes, claiming the misuse of the boots intended purpose for their own, is a choice of character. This trend is the final, and summarizing example of the aforementioned concept - that clothing and brands are used significantly as a means of self-expression. While the practical use of articles of clothing are critical in our decisions to wear them, at the end of the day, what wearing the clothing means, is more of a decider. To me, my Timberlands represent a time of transition in life and in myself - not only did my sense of fashion change, but I did. I wear my boots through rain or shine, indoor or out, because emphasizing my traits and personality is often more important than how I look to strangers on the street. Look within yourself, or even outside of yourself at your own outfit, and I bet you'll find each item you are wearing is on your body for more than meets the eye.
