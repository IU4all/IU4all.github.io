Feminist pins and political buttons in general were an American invention. They started out as a form of patriotism to celebrate the newly elected official and eventually evolved into a concise way to state a political opinion. Political pins can be considered both practical and sentimental objects. Since they can be worn on clothing, they can be considered practical. The sentimentality of the objects is due to the reflection of the owner's values and memories related to the object. Their importance when it relates to history in particular is due to the materiality of the object and the memory it evokes (which relates directly to the sentimentality). When talking about political pins as agents of history, Jean Augustine described them as "talking pieces". When a pin is shown to someone and they describe the memory they have associated with that pin, it begins a conversation that digs up related stories. The pin serves as a starting place for weaving the full history of an object together. Without the physicality of the pin, the conversation never would have began.

## Political Pins on the IU Campus 

In 1940, IU law graduate [Wendell Willkie](http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/metsnav3/general/index.html#mets=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.dlib.indiana.edu%2Fiudl%2Fgeneral%2Fmets%2FVAB9959&page=24) ran for president and used political pins as a way to change his campaign tactic from discussing himself to bashing his opponent, Franklin D. Roosevelt. The [Wendell Willkie pins](https://iubhistoryharvest.github.io/archiveitems/WilkiePin.html) are located in the IU Lilly Library Archives. At the beginning of Willkie's campaign, he inadvertently presented himself as his opponent with a few changes. This criticism by political journalists led to a decline in Willkie's popularity, so he began attacking Roosevelt (especially his approach to the oncoming war) as a way to regain his lead in the polls. A majority of the political pins available in the Lilly Library express negativity towards Franklin in three words or less. This object adds an extra layer of importance to material objects in history because it is phsycial evidence of Willkie's change in tactics during the presidential race. They still serve the same purpose of "talking pieces" as Jean Augustine described, although the story woven through these pins are on the opposite end of the political spectrum than the stories inspired by Jean Augustine' pins. 

More modern items that are present on campus include the [Pansexual Pride pin] (https://iubhistoryharvest.github.io/items/2019-03-05-ID0010.html) and the [Nasty Knitter pin](https://iubhistoryharvest.github.io/items/2019-03-019-ID0006.html). Both pins align with the ideological ideas that my object conveys. One was given as a gift in order to show support for the owner coming out, and the other was given as a gift after the first Women's March as a sign of support for the movement. Both objects have the same practical and sentimental  capabilities as the feminist pins do, although the pansexual pride pin would evoke a different set of memories associated with the LGBTQ+ community. The pansexual pin and the nasty knitter pin are also material objects from a turbulent time in history, similarly to the Wendell Willkie pins.
