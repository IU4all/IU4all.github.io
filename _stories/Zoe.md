Feminist pins and political buttons in general were an American invention. They started out as a form of patriotism to celebrate the newly elected official and eventually evolved into a concise way to state a political opinion. Their importance when it relates to history, however, is due to the materiality of the object and the memory it evokes. According to Jean Augustine, her political buttons serve as more than an expression of of political opinion. She describes her political pins as "talking pieces" that evoke memories from viewers. In other words, people that have memories associated with her political memorabilia will be reminded of that when they see or hear about the pins. This sparks the beginning of a conversation, which allows pins to be starting places for gathering information to weave a more accurate story. 
The pins serve both practical and sentimental use. Since pins are able to be worn, they are considered to be a practical item. Due to the reflection of the values of the wearer, as well as the memories assocaited with political pins, they can also have sentimental value.
