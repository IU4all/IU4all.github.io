Pictures are the most important tool in recording personal and academic history. They not only capture the events taking place, but they give people a sense of intimacy with the characters present. Words in a history textbook offer facts and data for understanding, but the visual aspect of a piece of history allows the viewer to place themselves in the scene and grasp the action in a new perspective. For example, [various pictures of WWI] (https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/world-war-i-history) show the emotions of grief on the battlefield and then patriotism on the streets of the United States. The true weight of these emotions canâ€™t be felt by simple textual evidence, and these photographs offer us an entry into the past.
