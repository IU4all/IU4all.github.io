Pictures are the most important tool in recording personal and academic history. They not only capture the events taking place, but they give people a sense of intimacy with the characters present. Words in a history textbook offer facts and data for understanding, but the visual aspect of a piece of history allows the viewer to place themselves in the scene and grasp the action in a new perspective. For example,[various pictures of WWI](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/world-war-i-history) show the emotions of grief on the battlefield and then patriotism on the streets of the United States. The true weight of these emotions can’t be felt by simple textual evidence, and these photographs offer us an entry into the past.

## Communication and Recording History through Images

Photos offer a universal language and were the first visual form of communication in the world. Ancient[cave and rock paintings](https://www.historyofvisualcommunication.com/01-rocks-and-caves) have been found from over 40,000 years ago. These images relay different drawing of various hunted animals and  created a way for hunters to communicate with each other about which beasts were in the area. Although years of technological innovations have allowed people from all over the world to communication within seconds, we still utilize pictures to record our own personal histories. 

With the rise of social media, digital history through photos has increased significantly. Applications such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook encourage their users to post pictures in order to share aspects of their life with the world. Snapchat, another form of social media, is based solely off of pictures and videos. Users can send their friends photos back and forth and then save these images into an archive within app literally labeled “Memories”. While most people think of these actions as a fun way to talk to your friends, these applications are actually recording each of our histories, and some will notify you a year after the picture was communicated, allowing you to reminisce on that period of your life. The increase in social media usage has improved the recording of personal stories, and together, all of these personal stories make up the history of our time period. 

I recorded a personal family memory when I took the photo of my sister, parents, and I wearing bunny ear headbands on Easter in 2016. As an outsider, it looks as if a typical Christian family messing around on an Easter Sunday, possibly after church or travelling to see more family members. Although, to me, this picture signifies the bond that my family shares and our goofy personalities when we get to all hang out, which isn’t very often. This picture reminds me of playing with my two dogs earlier in the day and attempting to place the same headbands on their heads, but they wouldn’t allow it to happen. These photographs allow the people in them to remember more about what was occuring in that time period or on that specific day. The Clarence Flaten family also took a photo similar to mine with historical differences. The older clothes, lack of color, and the way that the family is posed allows viewers to add historical context. Further descriptions show how life was different in that time period than it is to today. While these images offer historical value for future scholars to understand the lifestyle of the families in the pictures, they mean the most to me and my family because they record my personal relationship with the family members and allow me to reminisce on times in the house I grew up in. At the end of the day, your personal history, including dates, actions, and the people that create you, is the most important to your personal identity, and these photographed pictures deserve preservation.
