This picture was taken in March of 2016 on Easter. It’s significant to me because it’s one of the only pictures of my whole immediate family. Although we spend a lot of time together, we rarely take pictures, so this picture depicts the memories and history of our relationship. It signifies sentimental history and hangs up in my dorm room so that I can remember the people that I love who are far away. It was originally taken in Huntington, IN before we moved to Roanoke, IN, so the location is also significant to my personal history because I grew up in that house.
