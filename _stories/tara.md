In the performance world today, modern dance has much more prevalence than it has had in the past. Stemming from ballet, the new styles have both traditional and advanced components. Ballet usually portrays movement through a set of guidelines and rules while modern dance tends to be more abstract, pushing the preset boundaries of classic genres. Such a unique style allowed for dancers to begin thinking [outside of the box.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3849882) This being said, the dancers required different performance tools, which required a change in [dancewear,](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40259742?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) bringing us to the pirouette. These shoes were desirable when the styles were changing since it allowed for more grip on the floor with the open heel design. [Marie Camargo](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marie-Camargo) played a big role in the evolution of dance shoes. In the mid 18th century, she wanted to perform certain jumping skills, one called an entrechat and one called a cabriole, that were normally done by male dancers. In order to execute the necessary movements, she took the heels off of her ballet shoes, making her one of the first ballerinas to wear a non-heeled ballet shoe.

## Indiana University's Own History of Dance

Looking at today's society, it's easy to see how much dance has progressed. Dance at a university used to only be for recreational purposes, but now it can be offered as a [major](https://college.indiana.edu/academics/degrees-majors/major-guides/dance-bfa.html). It is also on record that IUB had a [dance program](http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/findingaids/archives/InU-Ar-VAD4124) that began in 1927. The founder of this program was dancer Jane Fox who came to IU's campus as a faculty member. Fox started this program because she wanted to teach what she called "natural dance" to the studets. Her idea for natural dance was having her students use modern dance techniques to portray feelings and ideas through movement. Originally, a part of the Women's Physical Education Department funded by the School of Education, this program eventually became prevalent and popular enough to turn dance into a respected major and minor at IU.

Digging deeper into Fox's dance program, you might notice that some of the collected images reflect dancers in odd positions and sometimes barefoot. This corresponds with the whole idea that modernized dance's prevalence in society has casued dance attire to evolve (such as in the case of the pirouette shoe). In some cases, dancers would prefer to dance barefoot if the movements were jarring enough to require maximum grip on the ground.

The use of pirouettes and Jane Fox's dance program can be viewed as symbols of change and modernization, both elements having planted their roots in their own unique progressive history.
