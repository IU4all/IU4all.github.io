This is a book about Alexander Hamilton written by Ron Chernow. 
This is a massive biography (819 total pages) about Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary of the United States. It has handwritten annotations (highlights, pencils, and flags) to note topics of significance.
The owner of this book is currently doing research on Alexander Hamilton. Their whole year has been learning about Hamilton and his life and how his letters correspond to the musical lyrics. This book has become a sort of security blanket for her. They take it everywhere. While it's incredibly heavy and takes up a lot of space, it comforts her. Also, it's honestly a great book to read.
