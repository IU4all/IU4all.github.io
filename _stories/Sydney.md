Around IU's Campus, art is a constant feature that adds to its individuality and beauty. There are statues all over campus that many pass with a quick glance. Their origins are fascinating. When Herman B Wells became president of IU in 1937, he made it his goal to transform IU into a 'cosmopolitan center' for international learning. Near Dunn Woods, resides the statues dubbed The Space Between us, a statue of Adam and Eve reaching toward each other. Jean-Paul, and IU art professor, finished the piece in 1968 (Mack, 2018).

However, art encompasses more than statues and paintings. Art can be a wide range of items as it can include any number of things. For example, there's performance art such as dance and theater, as well as sensory art which can encompass music, paintings, buildings, etc. Art, by definition, is ‘the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination.’ Not only does art, in its many forms, provide an outlet for people, it can also improve memory and concentration skills, as well as focus and discipline (Turbide, 2015). In order to become skilled in playing a guitar, painting, or being able to master the pirouette in Ballet, one must have discipline and persevere through mistakes. Failure leads to success.
