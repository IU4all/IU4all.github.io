# Technology We Use and Remember

Oftentimes, we surround ourselves with things that remind us of the good old days, or make us feel right at home. For some, it is a family picture from a vacation dear to them, and for others it’s an object such as fountain pens in a pocket protector. Some might say that it is old hat or archaic to have these items around at all when it is so much more convenient to have them on your smartphone or simply go out and buy a pack of ballpoint pens. If that is the case, why aren't these items cast aside, especially considering the convenience of modern technology? Indeed, ballpoint pens have supplanted  fountain pens as the prominent writing implement for good reason. However, through a balance of practicality and sentimentality, there is a lot to learn from objects such as an antique phone, an antique switchboard, a pocket protector, and a hidden payphone bank on campus.

We can better understand how communication worked in the past and how it affected gender by examining these objects. As somebody who restores antiques for fun, I’m frequently asked “why?” before being told that it’s really interesting and that I’m a nerd beyond belief. That’s fine, and I certainly can’t (and don’t want to) argue with that statement. It think that the history of the antique Stromberg-Carlson phone is especially revealing to rural life in early 1900s America. They were built ruggedly, putting out higher voltage than normal to reach urban connections along longer rural phone lines. The phone quickly became known as the farmer's friend due to its popularity and that legendarily you could hear the noises of the barnyard through the transmitter (University of Wisconsin).

The technological advances of this particular phone quickly add an element of gender into the mix when one factors into account the switchboard on display at the Monroe County Historical Society. In the early 20th century, most switchboard operators were women due to the long hours of sitting, intense focus required, and manual dexterity needed to work the plugs (Monroe County historical society). This precedent allowed women to join the workforce during and after WWII, an integral point of 20th Century feminism (Lipartito, 1994).

The fountain pens and pocket protector serve as a reminder of the difficulty involved in communicating with home in the past and how much modern tech has facilitated it. Fountain pens are especially fiddly, requiring blotting paper, ink refills, and plenty of patience to use properly. Indeed, it's not hard to imagine someone in the 1950s cursing at a pen that miraculously spewed ink over their handwritten letter to a sweetheart back home. The participant who had the pocket protector mentioned many such times the plastic pocket protector has saved a shirt from stains of indelible ink.

These nostalgic items truly remind us just what we owe to the inventors and workforces of the past, as well as how convenient our modern lives are.
