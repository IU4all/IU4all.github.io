Practical Sentimental
What happens when a piece of technology becomes obsolete? Is it just cast aside? Thrown away maybe? Is there even any place for it in modernity? If one looks hard enough, they will find that this technology is still around whether in the form of pocket protectors or an antique phone. Perhaps it even takes the form of a payphone booth on campus. This older technology that hangs around still serves as an important reminder of where we have come from and where we can go in our digital age. It even can give a hint to changing gender roles in regards to telecommunication.

Nostalgic Technology in Bloomington
Presently, a team of curators is hard at work to recreate a portion of a house from 1960s Bloomington in an exhibit at the Mathers Museum on campus. One can also find antique switchboards and interviews with telecommunications workers at the Monroe County Historical society. However, the search is not always that far even. Sometimes one just has to look nextdoor.
