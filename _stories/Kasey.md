Through societal development of technology and culture, simple daily objects such as a wallet change, and international insignias change. From the first wallets that were developed in the renaissance era, an overall change in society has created new ways to hold our not only payment cards, but digital currency as well. From the first class of students that were enrolled into the university to the class of 2020 celebrating the bicentennial of the university. Indiana University originated with a lack of a representative insignia but would later develop the first interlocking “IU” in the 1898 arbutus. Today the phone case wallet that was gifted by the Student Recreation Center represents the end of a story towards the development of the Indiana University Insignia.

## Interlocking The I and U 

The evolution of technology amongst college students have revolutionized the way that currency is to be carried. With simple accessibility and cellular devices always being on hand of younger generations, there is no longer a need to carry an item such as a [faux leather wallet](https://iubhistoryharvest.github.io/items/2019-03-019-ID0003.html). The Recreation center offers these to help students with carrying ID’s and credit cards when they are wearing athletic apparel that lack pockets. With room to carry up to 4 cards, there is a lack for the importance of carrying a wallet. Technological advancements have lessened the importance of physical currency and has made digital purchases much more convenient which is proven through the [Phone Wallet Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7204398B1/en)
 

Year after year a new arbutus is introduced representing the accomplishments that have been achieved through the years. The logo of IU is often an overlooked accomplishment of the creations that have been represented and is visualized as a daily aspect to the student atmosphere. The slight difference between the 1938 arbutus cover and the 1972 hockey team shows the evolutionary change of the objects. Sports teams showed during the 1938 period also lacked the placement of an interlocking IU within it as well, which teams would later adopt. in 1970 there is a [collection of potential drafts](http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/archivesphotos/search/search.do?userQuery=logo&sortKeys=&offset=0&facetFilters=DATE_TAKEN-part-year+exact+%221970%22&maxResults=10) that represent all of the potential logos that would be put into place to be Indiana Universities logo to this day. 


The first centennial of IU shows the gathering of IU Faculty and staff on the original Jorden baseball field that creates the image of an IU through apparel color. In 2020, IU will approach its bicentennial year celebrating all of the accomplishments that have been achieved. As noticed in the top left-hand corner, there is an alleged groundskeeper who was once in the photo proceeding with his daily work, interrupting this [accomplished photograph](http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/archivesphotos/results/item.do?itemId=P0022826&searchId=10&searchResultIndex=5)

The earliest form of an interlocking “IU” was discovered in the 1898 arbutus. Claude McDonald Hamilton from Huntington, Indiana creatively drew this first [IU](http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/archivesphotos/results/item.do?itemId=P0026900&searchId=20&searchResultIndex=8) Before this, the I and the U had been separated and would have never been seen interlocked. Indiana’s logo would maintain it’s interlocking from then on and it would primarily be found on athletic apparel. This would be the Logo for Indiana University up to the year 1916.
