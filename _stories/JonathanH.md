Clothing has always been an essential part of human history. It has taken a role in creation myths such as Adam and Eve, to expressing the socioeconomic status of any given individual. However, as culture changes so too does the meaning of clothes. Today, clothes that serve the same practical purpose have widely different meaning and expression. These personal interests often stem from the both the culture and environment someone grew up in (i.e. what someone wore in the 1980s is going to vary from what someone wore in the 2000s) rather than what is most practical. Clothing provides an outlet of self-expression that not only reveals an individualâ€™s personal interest, but also shows the culture and environment in which someone was raised. This kind of meaning in clothing today offers a much more unique variation where something such as plain as a shirt can now offer a plethora of meaning and expression.

The items in the Slocum Room, like the Nanoblock Eiffel Tower that inspired this story, reverse the course that Game Design majors take. Where IUB's major turns play into work, the Slocum Room has a host of puzzles that turn work into play. One puzzle in particular, [The Niagara Puzzle (with File and Compass)](http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/lilly/slocum/LL-SLO-000630) tells that story very well. It's a box-shaped puzzle that shows a drawing of a waterfall, presumably Niagara Falls (a popular tourist destination as early as the 18th century). Users are asked to get all of the little balls off of a "bank" (a small wooden piece set flat inside the puzzle at the top of the falls) into a "whirlpool", a hole at the top right corner of the box. Similar puzzles by the same manufacturer, R. Journet, were sent to British solders imprisoned in Germany during WWI with a hacksaw, a compass and a map hidden inside to facilitate their escape. 

These puzzles require manual dexterity, problem-solving skills, have application in real life--you try leveling the Eiffel Tower in miniature without thinking through the tenets of basic geometry!--and have an element of nostalgia that roots them in a particular historical context.
