We express ourselves often through our personal everyday things, such as our clothes and accessories. These items often seem forgettable as we see them everyday. However, those we meet take note of them and help find out who we are through them. These items often serve as extensions of ourselves, as well as indicating our socioeconomic status. Furthermore, these clothes and accessories show our culture and what it is like at the time. As culture changes and time passes, it becomes evident how these particular pieces of clothes and other wearable items reveal what the previous culture was like.
