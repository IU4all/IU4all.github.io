In a society consumed by work and productivity, it’s important to take time to decompress from the pressure of everyday life. Many people do this in the form of a hobby or an activity they enjoy. Often, people use an article of clothing or an object they use frequently in their hobby to symbolize a part of themselves. 

### A Brief History of Hobbies

Before 1880, a “hobby” was referred to as a dangerous obsession. With the introduction of the eight to five work day, employees worked shorter hours, but their time at work became more demanding. With more leisure time and a need to destress, people turned to other activities to keep them busy, and the word “hobby” gained a new connotation. Hobbies were now looked at as a productive way to spend leisure time. ([Gelber, 1999](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Cda_QMSGK3sC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=+Gelber+S+M.+%27%E2%80%99Hobbies:+leisure+and+the+Culture+of+Work+in+America%E2%80%99%E2%80%99+Columbia+University+Press,+1999,+p.+11.+&ots=fZiMxf_YAv&sig=ARUiOMrHujP6Tu2FxqX9g5Xb4bg#v=onepage&q&f=false))

### Self Expression and Hobbies

Hobbies can be looked at as a form of self-expression as well. That person had to consciously pick an activity they enjoy based on their personality, morals, and interests. For example, the [G&L Guitar] (https://iubhistoryharvest.github.io/items/2019-03-05-ID0004.htmlis) used to make music. When strangers see this guitar with its owner, they make assumptions about the owner’s personality and values. People look at musicians as hard working because it takes copious amounts of time to create pleasant music. This same thought process is used with other art forms.

Vans are a shoe that debuted in the 60's, and were quickly adopted by the skating community due to their waffle sole that allows them to grip skateboards very well. In 1977, the leather side stripe was added for durability, but it soon became the notable design for Vans shoes.
