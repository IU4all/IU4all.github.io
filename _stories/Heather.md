In a society consumed by work and productivity, it’s important to take time to decompress from the pressure of everyday life. Many people do this in the form of a hobby or an activity they enjoy. Often, people use an article of clothing or an object from their hobby to symbolize a part of themselves. 

### A Brief History of Hobbies

Before 1880, a “hobby” was referred to as a dangerous obsession. Without efficient technology, tasks that were needed to everyday life took much longer, and there was not a lot of free time. Therefore, if someone's time was consumed with something else other than life sustaining activities, it was looked at negatively. With the introduction of the eight to five work day during the Industrial Revolution, employees worked shorter hours, but their time at work became more demanding. With more leisure time and a need to destress, people turned to other activities to keep them busy, and the word “hobby” gained a new connotation. Hobbies were now looked at as a productive way to spend leisure time.

### Self Expression and Hobbies

Hobbies can be looked at as a form of self-expression as well. That person had to consciously pick an activity they enjoy based on their personality, morals, and interests. For example, the [G&L Guitar](https://iubhistoryharvest.github.io/items/2019-03-05-ID0004.htmlis) used to make music. When strangers see this guitar with its owner, they make assumptions about the owner’s personality and values. People look at musicians as hard working because it takes copious amounts of time to create pleasant music. This same thought process is used with other art forms.

### Hobbies and Community

People associate hobbies’ objects with the community of people who partake in the hobby as well. [Vans](https://iubhistoryharvest.github.io/items/2019-03-05-ID0009.html) are a shoe that debuted in the 60's, and were quickly adopted by the skating community due to their waffle sole that allows them to grip skateboards very well. In 1977, the leather side stripe was added for durability, but it soon became the notable design for Vans shoes. Vans became associated with the skating community and the characteristics of this community as well. This also led to people wearing Vans who did not skateboard simply because they liked the look or because they wanted to be associated with the characteristics of the skating community but did not skate. As a freshman at IU, I got a scooter to get to my classes quickly and to enjoy my commute. I got Vans to survive the wear and tear of the scooter, but now the shoes serve as a reminder to me of how much I have grown since first semester of college.

[Biking](https://iubhistoryharvest.github.io/archiveitems/CyclingClubPostcard.html) started as a hobby when the bicycle first debuted in the United States. In fact, IU had a cycling club that later gave way to the idea of Little 500, a bike race at IU where student riders race around a track for their organization or self-formed team. The introduction of the bicycle also played a crucial role in the [women’s suffrage movement](https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/pedaling-path-freedom) because it allowed women to move freely amongst the community because they didn’t have to rely on a man for transportation.
