Objects are often much more than their face value. Take for example a ring. One understands that it is jewelry, and possibly expensive. However, it can also stand as a symbol for a couple’s commitment to each other, or furthermore, their specific love story. In our everyday lives, we attach meaning to seemingly trivial objects, such as pictures or stuffed animals. These objects hold no real practical purpose, yet in our heart’s they hold their weight. A picture goes further than a photograph, instead capturing the moment, the people, and the smiling faces, and we adorn it in a frame. Where others see a picture, we see a story. My mother’s promise ring goes much further than a gift my father gave to my mother. To me, it represents their story of immigration and the obstacles they faced to raise their family.
