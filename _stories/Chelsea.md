Have you ever had a family member donate one of your items without asking you? And all of a sudden, you realize how important that item was to you. Objects are often much more than their face value. Sentimentality gives an item personality.
Take for example a ring. One understands that it is jewelry, and possibly expensive. However, it can also stand as a symbol for a couple’s commitment to each other, or furthermore, their specific love story. In my life, a ring that my father gave my mother become much more than the promise ring he first gave her. It symbolized the commitment they had for each other, even when she was still back in El Salvador and he was in America. It would go on to represent the obstacles they faced as new immigrants to a country that they didn’t know anything about. It would eventually become mine and represent the short history of my family in this county.
