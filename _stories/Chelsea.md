Have you ever had a family member donate one of your items without asking you? And all of a sudden, you realize how important that item was to you. Objects are often much more than their face value. Sentimentality gives an item personality.
Take for example a ring. One understands that it is jewelry, and possibly expensive. However, it can also stand as a symbol for a couple’s commitment to each other, or furthermore, their specific love story. In my life, a ring that my father gave my mother become much more than the promise ring he first gave her. It symbolized the commitment they had for each other, even when she was still back in El Salvador and he was in America. It would go on to represent the obstacles they faced as new immigrants to a country that they didn’t know anything about. It would eventually become mine and represent the short history of my family in this county.

## Other Simple Memories

A picture goes further than a photograph, instead capturing the moment, the people, and the smiling faces, and we adorn it in a frame. But the simplicity of the process today may cause it to be taken for granted. Originally, taking a photograph took heavy equipment and several hour or days of exposure before a crude photo would appear. Now, with the advancement of technology, anyone can snap a picture in seconds and most of society does. In this era, people post pictures of their lives on all types of social media. However, this does not take away the sentimentality we attach to certain pictures. Some pictures are worth going to a CVS or Walgreens to print out and place in a photo frame. 
[Sofia Ramirez’s photo] (https://iubhistoryharvest.github.io/items/2019-03-22-ID0008.html) of her senior night is a wonderful example of a story in a picture. It is the story of all she accomplished to get to that specific moment in time. Furthermore, she places it on her desk as a reminder of the constant love and support she receives from her family even though they are far. 
Another object that demonstrates this is a [pink stuffed teddy bear](https://iubhistoryharvest.github.io/items/2019-03-019-ID0002.html). To anyone but the owner of this teddy, it looks old, perhaps even at the point where someone would choose to throw it away. However, looking deeper into the history of this toy, one learns that the teddy bear originates from the owner’s home country and was a source of great comfort during some very difficult times. 
To an outsider, an object is just an object. There is no attachment and no story. We do not go in stores like Goodwill and think about the stories that those objects hold. But what would happen if we did? What could we learn about our history?
