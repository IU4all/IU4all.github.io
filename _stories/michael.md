People accumulate books for various reasons. Some books allow others to visit made-up worlds and fantasize about what could be. Other books record the history of a family or events. Books like these get plenty of wear and tear over their lives as people open them, fold their pages, highlight and make notes, and just use them for pleasure. What about the books that get forgotten because they're required for some class or another, they get shoved in a corner once they’ve outlived their usefulness. 

## Traditional Learning
We humans have a long history of learning, we’ve gone from using exclusively passing on information orally to having a veritable cornucopia of information at our fingertips. Up until a few centuries ago the only people who had access to education in the form of books, were the societal elites. As a result many children learned how to do things by being taken on as apprentices by masters of a given craft. The [Traditional Arts Indiana](https://traditionalarts.indiana.edu/Programs/REN%20Current%20Banners/index.html) maintains a series of banners that describe individuals or communities that pass on their knowledge of traditional art forms the traditional way. Systems of apprenticeship still exist for some vocations such as plumbers and HVAC technicians, but most individuals learn in a more modern fashion than in the days of yesteryear.

## Modern Education
By about the mid-19th century, elementary education was compulsory in many developed nations and with that came the need for mass-distributable education for the increasing number of [one-room schoolhouses](https://web.archive.org/web/20110716100225/http://www.snowkentucky.com/one_room_school.htm) which allowed a single teacher to teach many grades simultaneously. This was flawed, but it helped to disseminate a rudimentary education.  Over time one-room schoolhouses went the way of the dodo in most places, but they were replaced by more structured schools that grades were separated in order to cater more efficiently to their individual needs. Nowadays schools across the country use a variety of books to teach a fairly standardized curriculum to everyone from the ages of six to eighteen about many of the same topics covered in one-room schoolhouses. Once you get into higher education, the number of books explodes, ranging from books on organic chemistry
