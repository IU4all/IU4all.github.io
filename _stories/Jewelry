Play gets a lot of attention in the world of education. Play--in the form of video games like Code Combat or Osmo's [Coding Awbie](https://www.playosmo.com/en/coding/)--helps acclimate young children to the world of computer code. In the world of history, though, it's not the play that gets attention. It's the material effects of play on adult life, on consumer culture, on military history, that dominate the history of toys. In quotidian history, of the sort that focuses on every day life and the world of history and memory, toys fade into the background. My Nanoblock Eiffel Tower offers a glimpse of this version of "toy", in which the toy provides an avatar for play, home life, and travel.
