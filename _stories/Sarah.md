## More About Pins

 Pins have been used in the United States since 1789 for George Washingtonâ€™s first inauguration. Then, they were patented in 1892 by Benjamin Whitehead. These original pins were used to show support for political candidates. Wearing them in public would persuade ohers to vote for the same person. As we look at how buttons nad pins are used today, their use is similar, but it has broadened. You can now find pins for anything: political candidates, your favorite band, a quote from The Office, and of course gay pride. Pins are an extremely easy way to physically show off things that you enjoy. Pins are often used and given out for free by organizations that want attention or feedback from the public. For example, when I was in elementary school I remember receiving an "I <3 Richmond" pin from the mayor to encourage me to get involved in public activities in Richmond. Receiving this pansexual pride pin from my roommate was slightly different in the fact that it is representing more personally who I am and what I believe in rather than encouraging an action from others. Both uses of pins, however, allow the wearer to show some sort of support for an organization or belief.
