 Some people hide their sexuality while other people flaunt theirs. To me, sexuality is a large part of who you are and what you believe in. Wearing this pin on my backpack conveys this image of me to others. Pins and buttons can also have many other uses.

## More About Pins

 Pins have been used in the United States since 1789 for George Washingtonâ€™s first inauguration. Then, they were patented in 1892 by Benjamin Whitehead. These original pins were used to show support for political candidates. Wearing them in public would persuade ohers to vote for the same person. As we look at how buttons nad pins are used today, their use is similar, but it has broadened. You can now find pins for anything: political candidates, your favorite band, a quote from The Office, and of course gay pride. Pins are an extremely easy way to physically show off things that you enjoy. Pins are often used and given out for free by organizations that want attention or feedback from the public. For example, when I was in elementary school I remember receiving an "I <3 Richmond" pin from the mayor to encourage me to get involved in public activities in Richmond. Receiving this pansexual pride pin from my roommate was slightly different in the fact that it is representing more personally who I am and what I believe in rather than encouraging an action from others. Both uses of pins, however, allow the wearer to show some sort of support for an organization or belief.
 
### More About Sexuality and Pins at IU
 
  Many of the pins I found at Indiana University and in Bloomington fit into the different uses mentioned in the above section. For example, Wendell Willkie had multiple campaign buttons to offer support for his presedential campaign.The Monroe County History Center had many pins commemorating the RCA and how it helped the Bloomington community. The history center also had a hat covered in various pins. Included in this group of pins was a Coca-Cola pin. this shows that pins do not always have to convey a political message but rather can just be for fun or even aesthetics. Pins about sexuality are often seen around campus, probably due to the fact that the campus is very welcoming to sexual minorities. The organization just recently renamed as the LGBTQ+ Culture Center has been around since 1970. This group has its own building on campus that provides information, mental support, and scholarships to students of teh LGBTQ+ community. The LGBTQ+ Culture Center gives sometimes has t-shirts, pins, and other goodies they give away to advertise their organization and also to show their support to members of the community.
