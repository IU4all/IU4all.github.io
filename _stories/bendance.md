Since the advent of the acoustic guitar, the stringed instrument has found a quintessential position within the American style of performance. Pertaining to Bloomington, instrumentalists who utilized stringed instruments have become very relevant to the city’s culture.

## The Oud

The oud was an instrument utilized throughout the Arab world and was predecessor of the lute. The lute being an instrument that would be played throughout the European world, with even some iterations being brought to America. This early iteration of what would later become the guitar marks the starting point of how string instruments were first utilized by humans. Even though the oud has fallen out of fashion, the oud is still being played in traditional music throughout the Arab World.

## Local Figureheads

From the early colonial period to now, the guitar had been adapted. The form and structure of the modern Guitar is credited to Spanish guitar maker Antonio Torres Jurado, his design becoming wildly popular. Due to this innovation, the guitar found its place within the American style of music. Once again, Bloomington instrumentalists who utilized these instruments became well known figures within the city.
For example, Joshua Bell is an American Grammy award-winning violinist and conductor born in Bloomington, Indiana. Bell started becoming serious about music within his early teens and made his debut at Carnegie Hall when he was only seventeen. He eventually amassed a fortune of $15 million dollars and has left and is admired within his community as a local celebrity, as noted by his cardboard cutout standing proudly in the Monroe County History Center. 
Another shining example of Bloomington excellence is John Mellencamp, an American musician who was born in Seymour, Indiana in 1951. His commercial success within the music industry is attributed to his utilization of his guitar driven sound. He is relevant to Bloomington’s culture due his long-term residency near Lake Monroe. An autographed guitar of his sits in the Monroe County History Center.

## Commodification 

These people became relevant to the Bloomington culture due to their proficiency with their respective stringed instrument. Aside from the rich and famous, the average individual seeks music stores to cater to their guitar oriented needs. After the guitar became standardized within the mid-19th century, many entrepreneurs sought to utilize the guitar’s popular sound to bring them wealth.
G&L is a guitar design and production company that was founded by Leo Fender, George Fullerton, and Dale Hyatt in 1979. G&L instruments were an attempt by Leo Fender and his associates to create a more perfected version of the Fender guitar. The small scale of its production allows for more customization of their instruments.
I bought my own G&L guitar in early 2018 from a guitar shop that my family’s been going to for three generations. This is my first real guitar that’s not a hand-me-down from a previous family member. I practice almost every day and make music regularly. 

## Conclusion

From the guitar’s origins, to their modern day standing within pop culture, the guitar has been a widely recognized staple of American culture for centuries. The proficient figures within Bloomington society who become recognized due to their skills with stringed instruments further solidify their standing within Bloomington’s own culture. Guitar’s widespread influence throughout the global culture at large is what led me, along with many others to purchase their own guitars. This is a consumerist phenomenon of musicians purchasing their own instruments to help better themselves, aligned with America’s capitalistic ideals, and entrepreneurial ideals.
