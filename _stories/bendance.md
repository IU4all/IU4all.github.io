Since the advent of the acoustic guitar, the instrument has found a quintessential place within the American style of music. Pertaining to Bloomington, instrumentalists who utilized stringed instruments became most relevant to the city’s culture.
For example, Joshua Bell is a American Grammy award-winning violinist and conductor born in Bloomington, Indiana. Bell started becoming serious about music within his early teens and made his debut at Carnegie Hall when he was only seventeen. He eventually amassed a fortune of $15 million dollars and has left and is admired within his community as a local celebrity, as noted by his cardboard cutout standing proudly in the Monroe County History Center. 
Another shining example of Bloomington excellence, John Mellencamp is an American musician who was born in Seymour, Indiana in 1951. His commercial success within the music industry is attributed to his utilization of his guitar driven sound. He is relevant to Bloomington’s culture due his long term residency near Lake Monroe. An autographed guitar of his sits in the Monroe County History Center.
