 The oud is a guitar-like, pear-shaped stringed instrument with 11 or 13 strings grouped in 5 or 6 courses. This instrument is commonly used in Western Asian and North African music. Earlier iterations of the Oud influenced the production of the European Lute. 

 As the Lute spread throughout Europe, the instrument evolved into the modern guitar.
