 Thomas Benton was hired to make a mural that would present the history of Indiana for the Chicago Worldâ€™s Fair, in 1933. These murals have sparked controversy as one particular panel contains a depiction of the Ku Klux Klan.

 As many students felt that the mural containing this image was affecting their learning, the room in Woodburn hall that contains it no longer holds class. However, the rest of the mural can be viewed in the Auditorium near Showalter Fountain.
