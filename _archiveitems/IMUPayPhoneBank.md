These booths are situated in the Indiana Memorial Union, hidden away on the first floor. There are 5 individual booths, which once housed payphones for student access. These booths feature a seat, writing desk, fans, and a light that activates when the door is closed to indicate that the booth is occupied. While no longer functional, these booths serve as a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era in telecommunications.
