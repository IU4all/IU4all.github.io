 This item is a black and white photograph of a caricature painting done by Ralph F. Thompson of Thomas Hart Benson, a historically famous painter. The caricature painting has a serious tone, noted from Benson's earnest facial expression, but has hints of irony and comedic overtones. Benson's muscles are a main subject of the caricature exaggeration, and he appears holding an axe. A painting of Benson's own typical design (pre-industrial cabins) sits in the background.
