  This pin from the Monroe County History Center is from RCA, an electronic company that had a factory in Bloomington. This pin is important because it symbolizes the growth and development RCA allowed Bloomington to have; both industry and women gained from this corporation. This pin would be worn as pride in the company who helped so many people.

 I discovered this pin when our class visited the Monroe County History Center to learn more about local history. This pin was one object of many in the RCA exhibit which our class walked through and talked about together. The pin is a reminder of Bloomington history and of a company that seemed to help many women find jobs.
