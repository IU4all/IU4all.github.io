 This t-shirt was made for the Cascades Golf Team, who were sponsored by The Herald Times, a local newspaper. Golfing saw a continued rise in popularity throughout the 1980s in the United States, both within and outside of the sport (being the backdrop for some popular movies during the decade). Golfing was considered to be a country club sport at this time, and was often associated with upper class leisure. Golfing began to decline in the United States after 2002, and thus such shirts are no longer seen nearly as often outside of golfing events.
