 This item is a poster about the Naptown Knitters, a group of men who gather around a large table every Sunday and Wednesday to knit scarves and hats for charity. As new members rotate into the group, the men teach one another how to cast-on, knit, and sometimes crochet. They share techniques, offer advice, and troubleshoot problems.
