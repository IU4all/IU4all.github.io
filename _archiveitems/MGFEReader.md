 McGuffeyâ€™s Fourth Eclectic Reader was the fourth entry in the series of reading primers produced by William McGuffey. The fourth reader was designed to be used by students with a very high aptitude for reading and writing. Topics contained within this reader included punctuation, articulation, and accent and inflection, but mainly contained works of prose and poetry with assorted exercises for the students to study.
