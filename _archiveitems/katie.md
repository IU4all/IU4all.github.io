 This picture includes members of Clarence's family and friends and was taken at their house on South Washington St. in Bloomington. Mr. and Mrs. Walker are Peggy's Godparents. Mr. and Mrs. Walker are probably Joseph A. and Catherine E. Walker who lived at 1423 S. Washington. It was taken in 1948, and it is very interesting to see the relationship between the children and adults.
