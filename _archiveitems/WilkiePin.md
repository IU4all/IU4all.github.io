itemabout: |
 Wendell Lewis Willkie, an Indiana University law graduate, was the Republican presidential nominee in the 1940 election. During this time, World War II was beginning to concern America and the growth in popularity of globalism was increasing. There was a serious lack of potential candidates in the Republican party that Republican constituents were pleased with, as other potential candidates were too concerned with domestic policy instead of foreign policy. However, Willkie was not as popular as Republicans hoped. He inadvertently presented himself as Franklin Roosevelt, but with a few adjustments. In an effort to win, he changed campaign tactics to attack Roosevelt, which worked well enough to convince Roosevelt to begin campaigning much more heavily. Ultimately, Willkie lost the presidential election to Roosevelt.

 The change in Willkie’s political tactics are reflected in the political pins that were produced during his campaign. The popularity of the political buttons that ridiculed Roosevelt for running for a third term showed how the population received Willkie’s change in political tactics, as well as what specifically was negative about running for a third term.
