 This item is a bronze-casted statue that pays homage to Herman B Wells, who served as IU's president from 1937 to 1962. Through his leadership, IU transformed into a ‘cosmopolitan center’ for international learning (Capshew). An early triumph of the Wells administration was the implementation of Thomas Benton’s Indiana Murals that are placed in the Auditorium as well as in Woodburn Hall

 Students often rub the thumb of the statue for good luck! It’s a tradition that many students partake in, which is why his thumb is a goldish color compared to the rest of the statue
