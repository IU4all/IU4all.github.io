itemabout: |
 The earliest form of an interlocking ”IU” was discovered in the 1898 arbutus. Claude McDonald Hamilton from Huntington, Indiana creatively drew this image. Before this, the I and the U had been separated and would have never been seen interlocked. Indiana’s logo would maintain it’s interlocking from then on and it would primarily be found on athletic apparel. This would be the Logo for Indiana University up to the year 1916 where it would be a newly redesigned interlocking IU.
