 This picture includes members of Clarence Flaten's family and friends and was taken at their house on South Washington St. in Bloomington. Mr. and Mrs. Walker are Peggy's Godparents. Mr. and Mrs. Walker are probably Joseph A. and Catherine E. Walker who lived at 1423 S. Washington. It was taken in 1948, and it is very interesting to see the relationship between the children and adults.

 Similar photos of the Flaten family in various locations in Bloomington are in the same archive collection.
