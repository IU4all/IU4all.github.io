itemabout: |
  This is a postcard that shows people enjoying a bike ride at IU in the early 20th century. Bikes were seen as a hobby item at first rather than a mode of transportation and are showcased in the Little 500 here at IU. Now, bikes are used as a mode of transportation in Bloomington, a way to stay fit, and a hobby. 
itemquote: |
 The modern bicycle made its first appearance in the United States around 1880, becoming very popular in the state of Indiana.
