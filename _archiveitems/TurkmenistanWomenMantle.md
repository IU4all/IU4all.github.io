itemabout: |
 This robe/garment was worn by women in the Tekke Turkomen, hand-made using silk and cotton. Women would wear this garment only if they had achieved a respected place in this society, expressing that they were either middle-aged and/or of marital status. The patterns embroidered onto this garment showed several natural objects, such as tulips and rams’ horns. These symbols are culturally significant to the Tekke Turkomen, as they were nomadic and focused much on the natural elements surrounding them.
